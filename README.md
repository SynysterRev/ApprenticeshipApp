# JuniorOnly

Project Overview

A job platform designed specifically for entry-level candidates and career changers looking for their first permanent (CDI) or fixed-term (CDD) positions.
It helps users filter out misleading "junior" offers and makes the job search easier and more relevant, with search options by sector, location, and contract type.
